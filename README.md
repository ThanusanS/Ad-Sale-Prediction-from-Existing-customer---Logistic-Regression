# Ad Sale Prediction from Existing Customers  
### Logistic Regression | Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether an **existing customer will purchase a product after seeing a digital advertisement**, using **Logistic Regression**.  
The model is trained on customer demographic data such as **Age** and **Salary**.

This is a **binary classification problem**:
- `0` → Customer did **not** purchase  
- `1` → Customer **purchased**
